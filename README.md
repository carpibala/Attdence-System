The table should be dynamic by use functions to insert rows. Therefore, when the 
webpage is first loaded or reloaded, the populate() function is called to insert rows of 
sample student records into the absentees table. All students are assumed absent at the 
beginning. Note: in this, it directly adds a group of names inside the function. 
• The webpage is responsive – when the device width gets to be less than or equal to 600 
pixels, then the three columns will stack on top of each other instead of next to each other.
